# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. They help ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to change along with it.

## What Are Structural Patterns in Simple Terms?

Structural patterns are like different ways to build and connect the parts of your program. They help you:

1. Organize different pieces of your code into a coherent whole
2. Connect objects and classes in flexible ways
3. Simplify complex relationships between components
4. Adapt incompatible interfaces to work together

Think of them as architectural blueprints that show how to assemble the building blocks of your program into stable, efficient structures.

## List of Key Structural Design Patterns

1. **Adapter Pattern** - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
   * *In simple terms*: Acts like a converter that lets objects with incompatible interfaces talk to each other (like a power adapter that lets you plug your device into a foreign outlet)

2. **Bridge Pattern** - Separates an abstraction from its implementation so both can vary independently
   * *In simple terms*: Splits a large class into two separate hierarchies—what it does and how it does it—that can be developed separately (like separating a remote control from the devices it controls)

3. **Composite Pattern** - Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies
   * *In simple terms*: Lets you treat individual objects and groups of objects the same way (like how a file system treats individual files and folders with the same operations)

4. **Decorator Pattern** - Attaches additional responsibilities to objects dynamically
   * *In simple terms*: Adds new features to objects without modifying their class (like adding toppings to a pizza without changing the base pizza)

5. **Facade Pattern** - Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
   * *In simple terms*: Creates a simple front door to a complex system (like a car dashboard that hides the complexity of the engine)

6. **Flyweight Pattern** - Uses sharing to support large numbers of similar objects efficiently
   * *In simple terms*: Reuses existing similar objects to save memory (like sharing common formatting between thousands of characters in a text editor)

7. **Proxy Pattern** - Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it
   * *In simple terms*: Acts as a stand-in for another object, controlling access to it (like a bouncer who checks ID before letting people into a club)

## When to Use Structural Patterns

Use structural patterns when:

1. You need to simplify complex subsystems
2. You want to make unrelated classes work together
3. You need to add responsibilities to objects dynamically
4. You want to organize objects into tree-like structures
5. You need to optimize resource usage with many similar objects

### For Beginners:
- Start with Adapter and Facade as they're the most intuitive
- These patterns help you connect different parts of your system or simplify complex parts
- They're useful when working with external libraries or legacy code

### For Experienced Developers:
- Look for opportunities to use these patterns to create cleaner separations between components
- Consider how these patterns can improve code maintainability and testability
- Use these patterns to manage dependencies between subsystems
- Remember that the goal is simplification—if using the pattern makes things more complex, reconsider

Each pattern addresses specific structural challenges, helping you create more flexible and maintainable software architectures.
