# Proxy Pattern

The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### 1. What the Pattern is in Simple Terms

The Proxy pattern is like having a representative who acts on your behalf. Think of a celebrity's agent who manages access to the celebrity - you have to go through the agent first before you can talk to the celebrity.

In software, a proxy acts as an intermediary that controls access to the original object (called the "real subject"). The proxy implements the same interface as the real subject, so clients can't tell whether they're working with the real object or the proxy. This allows the proxy to perform additional operations before or after forwarding requests to the real subject.

### 2. Core Components

1. **Subject Interface**: The common interface implemented by both the RealSubject and Proxy
2. **Real Subject**: The real object that the proxy represents
3. **Proxy**: The surrogate that controls access to the real subject
4. **Client**: The code that interacts with the subject through the proxy

### 3. Simple Implementation Example

```javascript
// Subject Interface (using JavaScript conventions)
class Subject {
  request() {
    throw new Error('request() method must be implemented');
  }
}

// Real Subject
class RealSubject extends Subject {
  request() {
    return 'RealSubject: Handling request';
  }
}

// Proxy
class Proxy extends Subject {
  constructor(realSubject) {
    super();
    this.realSubject = realSubject;
  }
  
  request() {
    // We can perform operations before forwarding to the real subject
    this.beforeRequest();
    
    // Forward the request to the real subject
    const result = this.realSubject.request();
    
    // We can perform operations after forwarding to the real subject
    this.afterRequest();
    
    return result;
  }
  
  beforeRequest() {
    console.log('Proxy: Before forwarding the request to the RealSubject');
  }
  
  afterRequest() {
    console.log('Proxy: After forwarding the request to the RealSubject');
  }
}

// Client code
function clientCode(subject) {
  console.log(subject.request());
}

console.log('Client: Executing the client code with a RealSubject:');
const realSubject = new RealSubject();
clientCode(realSubject);

console.log('');

console.log('Client: Executing the same client code with a Proxy:');
const proxy = new Proxy(realSubject);
clientCode(proxy);

/*
Output:
Client: Executing the client code with a RealSubject:
RealSubject: Handling request

Client: Executing the same client code with a Proxy:
Proxy: Before forwarding the request to the RealSubject
RealSubject: Handling request
Proxy: After forwarding the request to the RealSubject
*/
```

In this example:
- `Subject` defines the common interface
- `RealSubject` is the actual object that does the real work
- `Proxy` controls access to the `RealSubject` and performs additional operations
- The client works with both the `RealSubject` and `Proxy` through the same interface
- The proxy allows for pre- and post-processing around the real subject's behavior

### 4. Practical Real-World Example: Image Loading with Lazy Proxy

```javascript
// A practical example: Image loading with lazy initialization proxy

// Subject Interface
class Image {
  constructor(url) {
    this.url = url;
  }
  
  display() {
    throw new Error('display() method must be implemented');
  }
  
  getUrl() {
    return this.url;
  }
}

// Real Subject
class RealImage extends Image {
  constructor(url) {
    super(url);
    this.loadImage();
  }
  
  loadImage() {
    console.log(`Loading image from ${this.url}`);
    // In a real implementation, this would involve network requests
    // and image processing which could be expensive
    this.simulateNetworkLatency();
    console.log(`Image ${this.url} loaded`);
  }
  
  simulateNetworkLatency() {
    // Simulate loading time
    console.log(`Heavy network operation for ${this.url}...`);
  }
  
  display() {
    console.log(`Displaying image ${this.url}`);
  }
}

// Proxy
class ProxyImage extends Image {
  constructor(url) {
    super(url);
    this.realImage = null;
  }
  
  // Lazy initialization - only create the real image when needed
  display() {
    if (this.realImage === null) {
      console.log(`ProxyImage: Creating RealImage for ${this.url} on first access`);
      this.realImage = new RealImage(this.url);
    } else {
      console.log(`ProxyImage: Using cached RealImage for ${this.url}`);
    }
    
    this.realImage.display();
  }
  
  // Optional: Add proxy-specific methods
  getImageInfo() {
    return {
      url: this.url,
      isLoaded: this.realImage !== null,
      accessCount: this.accessCount
    };
  }
}

// Image Gallery Manager - Client code
class ImageGallery {
  constructor() {
    this.images = [];
  }
  
  addImage(url) {
    // Use ProxyImage instead of loading all images immediately
    const image = new ProxyImage(url);
    this.images.push(image);
    console.log(`Added image ${url} to gallery`);
    return this.images.length - 1; // Return the index
  }
  
  displayImage(index) {
    if (index >= 0 && index < this.images.length) {
      console.log(`Displaying image at index ${index}`);
      this.images[index].display();
      return true;
    } else {
      console.log(`Invalid image index: ${index}`);
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  preloadAll() {
    console.log('Preloading all images...');
    this.images.forEach((image, index) => {
      console.log(`Preloading image ${index}`);
      image.display();
    });
  }
  
  getImageCount() {
    return this.images.length;
  }
}

// Usage
function demonstrateImageGallery() {
  const gallery = new ImageGallery();
  
  // Add several images to the gallery (but they don't load yet thanks to the proxy)
  const index1 = gallery.addImage('https://example.com/image1.jpg');
  const index2 = gallery.addImage('https://example.com/image2.jpg');
  const index3 = gallery.addImage('https://example.com/image3.jpg');
  
  console.log(`Gallery contains ${gallery.getImageCount()} images\n`);
  
  // Display one image - this will load the actual image data
  console.log('\n--- Displaying first image ---');
  gallery.displayImage(index1);
  
  // Display it again - notice it doesn't reload
  console.log('\n--- Displaying first image again ---');
  gallery.displayImage(index1);
  
  // Display another image
  console.log('\n--- Displaying another image ---');
  gallery.displayImage(index2);
  
  // We never display the third image, so it's never loaded
  console.log('\n--- Gallery demonstration complete ---');
  console.log('Notice that image3.jpg was never loaded because it was never displayed');
}

// Run the demonstration
demonstrateImageGallery();
```

This example demonstrates:
- A virtual proxy that delays loading expensive resources (images) until they are actually needed
- Transparent usage - the client code doesn't need to know about the proxy's existence
- Memory and performance optimization by avoiding unnecessary resource loading
- Caching - once the real image is loaded, further requests use the cached version

This pattern is commonly used in real-world applications for:
1. Optimizing resource usage in media-heavy applications
2. Implementing "lazy loading" for better performance
3. Reducing initial load times by deferring non-critical resource loading

### 5. When to Use This Pattern

Use the Proxy pattern when:
- You need to control access to an object (protection proxy)
- You want to delay the creation of expensive objects until needed (virtual proxy)
- You need to implement caching for results of expensive operations (caching proxy)
- You need to check if the client has the required access rights (protection proxy)
- You need to coordinate access to a remote resource (remote proxy)
- You need to log access to an object (logging proxy)
- You need to add reference counting to handle shared objects (smart reference proxy)

Common use cases:
- Lazy loading of resources (images, videos, large data)
- Access control and authentication
- Caching and memoization
- Logging and monitoring
- Remote object access (like in microservices)
- Object lifecycle management
- Transaction management

### 6. Benefits and Drawbacks

**Benefits:**
- **Access Control**: Provides a controlled way to access the real subject
- **Lazy Initialization**: Can delay creating expensive objects until needed
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separates additional behavior from the core functionality
- **Protection**: Shields clients from the complexities of working with the real subject
- **Transparency**: Clients don't need to know they're working with a proxy
- **Improved Performance**: Through caching, lazy loading, and optimized access

**Drawbacks:**
- **Increased Complexity**: Adds another layer to the system
- **Potential Latency**: May introduce slight delays due to additional indirection
- **Implementation Overhead**: Requires creating additional classes
- **Possible Behavioral Differences**: The proxy might not behave exactly like the real subject in all cases
- **Overuse**: Can lead to a confusing design if overused
- **Memory Consumption**: Multiple proxies can consume additional memory

The Proxy pattern is particularly valuable when you need to add behavior to an object without modifying its interface or implementation. It's a powerful tool for controlling access to objects, optimizing resource usage, and implementing cross-cutting concerns like logging or security.
