# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns focus on how objects interact and communicate with each other. They help manage algorithms, relationships, and responsibilities between objects while making these interactions flexible, manageable, and efficient.

## What Are Behavioral Patterns in Simple Terms?

Behavioral patterns are like recipes for how objects should talk to each other and work together. They help solve common communication problems between objects in a way that makes your code:

1. More flexible and easier to change
2. Better at handling complex interactions
3. More organized and easier to understand

Think of them as established "conversation patterns" between objects that have proven effective across many software projects.

## List of Key Behavioral Design Patterns

1. **Strategy Pattern** - Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable
   
2. **Observer Pattern** - Defines a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about events

3. **Command Pattern** - Turns a request into a stand-alone object containing all information about the request

4. **Iterator Pattern** - Provides a way to access elements of a collection without exposing its underlying structure

5. **Template Method Pattern** - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, letting subclasses override specific steps

6. **State Pattern** - Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes

7. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern** - Passes a request along a chain of handlers until one processes it

8. **Mediator Pattern** - Reduces chaotic dependencies between objects by making them communicate indirectly through a mediator object

9. **Memento Pattern** - Captures and restores an object's internal state without violating encapsulation

10. **Visitor Pattern** - Lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate

11. **Interpreter Pattern** - Defines a grammar for a language and an interpreter to interpret sentences

## When to Use Behavioral Patterns

Use behavioral patterns when:

1. You need flexible ways for objects to communicate
2. You want to reduce tight coupling between objects
3. You need to distribute responsibilities between objects in a clean way
4. You want to encapsulate behaviors that can change frequently

Each pattern addresses specific communication challenges, helping you build more maintainable and flexible software systems.
