# Factory Method Pattern

The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

### 1. What the Pattern is in Simple Terms

The Factory Method pattern is like a specialized manufacturing facility in your code. Instead of directly creating objects with `new`, you use a special method (the factory method) that creates and returns objects for you. 

The key aspect is that this pattern allows subclasses to decide what specific type of object to create, while still adhering to a common interface. Think of it as different bakeries (subclasses) that all create pastries (objects) but each bakery decides what specific kind of pastry to make.

### 2. Core Components

1. **Creator**: The abstract class or interface that declares the factory method
2. **Concrete Creator**: Subclasses that implement the factory method to produce objects
3. **Product**: The interface that defines what the factory creates
4. **Concrete Product**: The specific object types that get created
5. **Factory Method**: The method that actually creates and returns product objects

### 3. Simple Implementation Example

```javascript
// Product interface (using JS convention)
class Product {
  operation() {
    throw new Error("Operation method must be implemented by concrete products");
  }
}

// Concrete Products
class ConcreteProductA extends Product {
  operation() {
    return "Result of ConcreteProductA";
  }
}

class ConcreteProductB extends Product {
  operation() {
    return "Result of ConcreteProductB";
  }
}

// Creator - the class with the factory method
class Creator {
  // Factory method - must be overridden by subclasses
  createProduct() {
    throw new Error("Factory method must be implemented by concrete creators");
  }
  
  // Some business logic that uses the factory method
  someOperation() {
    // Call the factory method to create a Product object
    const product = this.createProduct();
    
    // Use the product
    return `Creator: The same creator's code has just worked with ${product.operation()}`;
  }
}

// Concrete Creators override the factory method to change the resulting product type
class ConcreteCreatorA extends Creator {
  createProduct() {
    return new ConcreteProductA();
  }
}

class ConcreteCreatorB extends Creator {
  createProduct() {
    return new ConcreteProductB();
  }
}

// Client code
function clientCode(creator) {
  console.log(creator.someOperation());
}

// Application can configure itself with different creators
console.log("App: Launched with ConcreteCreatorA.");
clientCode(new ConcreteCreatorA());

console.log("App: Launched with ConcreteCreatorB.");
clientCode(new ConcreteCreatorB());

// Output:
// App: Launched with ConcreteCreatorA.
// Creator: The same creator's code has just worked with Result of ConcreteProductA
// App: Launched with ConcreteCreatorB.
// Creator: The same creator's code has just worked with Result of ConcreteProductB
```

In this example:
- `Product` defines what all products must do (the `operation` method)
- `ConcreteProductA` and `ConcreteProductB` are specific product implementations
- `Creator` declares the factory method and includes logic that uses the products
- The concrete creators override the factory method to return different product types
- The client code works with creators without knowing the specific product class being used

### 4. Practical Real-World Example: Payment Processor

```javascript
// Payment processor example - a common scenario in e-commerce applications

// Product interface - Payment Method
class PaymentMethod {
  constructor(amount) {
    this.amount = amount;
  }
  
  processPayment() {
    throw new Error("Each payment method must implement processPayment");
  }
  
  getPaymentDetails() {
    throw new Error("Each payment method must implement getPaymentDetails");
  }
}

// Concrete Products - Different Payment Methods
class CreditCardPayment extends PaymentMethod {
  constructor(amount, cardNumber, cvv, expiryDate) {
    super(amount);
    this.cardNumber = cardNumber;
    this.cvv = cvv;
    this.expiryDate = expiryDate;
  }
  
  processPayment() {
    // In a real app, this would connect to a payment gateway
    console.log(`Processing credit card payment of $${this.amount}`);
    console.log(`Using card ending with ${this.cardNumber.slice(-4)}`);
    return { success: true, transactionId: 'cc_' + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9) };
  }
  
  getPaymentDetails() {
    return {
      method: 'Credit Card',
      amount: this.amount,
      cardLastFour: this.cardNumber.slice(-4),
      expiryDate: this.expiryDate
    };
  }
}

class PayPalPayment extends PaymentMethod {
  constructor(amount, email) {
    super(amount);
    this.email = email;
  }
  
  processPayment() {
    // In a real app, this would use PayPal's API
    console.log(`Processing PayPal payment of $${this.amount}`);
    console.log(`Using account: ${this.email}`);
    return { success: true, transactionId: 'pp_' + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9) };
  }
  
  getPaymentDetails() {
    return {
      method: 'PayPal',
      amount: this.amount,
      email: this.email
    };
  }
}

class BankTransferPayment extends PaymentMethod {
  constructor(amount, accountNumber, routingNumber) {
    super(amount);
    this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
    this.routingNumber = routingNumber;
  }
  
  processPayment() {
    // In a real app, this would initiate a bank transfer
    console.log(`Processing bank transfer of $${this.amount}`);
    console.log(`To account: ${this.accountNumber.slice(-4)}`);
    return { success: true, transactionId: 'bt_' + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9) };
  }
  
  getPaymentDetails() {
    return {
      method: 'Bank Transfer',
      amount: this.amount,
      accountLastFour: this.accountNumber.slice(-4)
    };
  }
}

// Creator - Payment Processor Factory
class PaymentProcessorFactory {
  createPaymentMethod(type, amount, ...args) {
    switch (type.toLowerCase()) {
      case 'credit_card':
        const [cardNumber, cvv, expiryDate] = args;
        return new CreditCardPayment(amount, cardNumber, cvv, expiryDate);
      
      case 'paypal':
        const [email] = args;
        return new PayPalPayment(amount, email);
        
      case 'bank_transfer':
        const [accountNumber, routingNumber] = args;
        return new BankTransferPayment(amount, accountNumber, routingNumber);
        
      default:
        throw new Error(`Payment method ${type} is not supported.`);
    }
  }
}

// Order Processing System - the client code
class OrderProcessor {
  constructor() {
    this.paymentFactory = new PaymentProcessorFactory();
  }
  
  processOrder(order, paymentDetails) {
    console.log(`Processing order #${order.id} for $${order.total}`);
    
    // Create the appropriate payment method using the factory
    const paymentMethod = this.paymentFactory.createPaymentMethod(
      paymentDetails.type,
      order.total,
      ...paymentDetails.data
    );
    
    // Process the payment (without knowing which specific payment method is used)
    const result = paymentMethod.processPayment();
    
    if (result.success) {
      console.log(`Payment successful! Transaction ID: ${result.transactionId}`);
      // Store the payment details with the order
      order.paymentDetails = paymentMethod.getPaymentDetails();
      order.status = 'PAID';
      return { success: true, order };
    } else {
      console.error(`Payment failed: ${result.error}`);
      order.status = 'PAYMENT_FAILED';
      return { success: false, error: result.error };
    }
  }
}

// Usage example
const orderProcessor = new OrderProcessor();

// Sample order
const order = {
  id: "ORD-12345",
  items: [
    { name: "Product 1", price: 50 },
    { name: "Product 2", price: 25 }
  ],
  total: 75,
  status: 'PENDING'
};

// Process with credit card
const ccResult = orderProcessor.processOrder(order, {
  type: 'credit_card',
  data: ['4111111111111111', '123', '01/2025']
});

// Later in the code, process with PayPal
const paypalOrder = {
  id: "ORD-67890",
  items: [
    { name: "Premium Plan", price: 99 }
  ],
  total: 99,
  status: 'PENDING'
};

const ppResult = orderProcessor.processOrder(paypalOrder, {
  type: 'paypal',
  data: ['customer@example.com']
});

// Show the stored payment details
console.log("Credit Card Order:", ccResult.order);
console.log("PayPal Order:", ppResult.order);
```

This example demonstrates a real-world payment processing system where:
- Different payment methods (products) share a common interface but have unique implementations
- The factory creates the appropriate payment method based on the requested type
- The order processor works with any payment method without knowing its specific class
- New payment methods can be added by extending the product hierarchy and updating the factory

### 5. When to Use This Pattern

Use the Factory Method pattern when:
- You don't know ahead of time what types of objects your code will need to create
- You want to delegate the creation of objects to subclasses
- You need to create different objects based on specific conditions
- You want to provide users of your library a way to extend its internal components
- You want to reuse existing objects instead of rebuilding them each time (object pools)

Common use cases:
- Plugin architectures where new functionality can be added by creating new classes
- Payment processing systems that handle multiple payment methods
- Document generators that can create different document formats
- UI frameworks that need to create platform-specific components
- Database connectors that work with different database types

### 6. Benefits and Drawbacks

**Benefits:**
- **Flexibility**: Simplifies adding new product types without changing existing code
- **Decoupling**: Removes direct dependencies on concrete product classes
- **Adherence to SRP**: Moves product creation code to one place, adhering to the single responsibility principle
- **Adherence to OCP**: You can introduce new types of products without breaking existing code (open/closed principle)
- **Customization Points**: Provides hooks for subclasses to customize object creation logic

**Drawbacks:**
- **Complexity**: Adds more classes and interfaces to the codebase
- **Indirection**: Introduces another layer, making the code harder to read and follow
- **Inheritance Limitations**: Relies on inheritance which can be limiting (especially in languages with single inheritance)
- **Overuse**: Sometimes simpler creational approaches are sufficient
- **Initialization Parameters**: Can get complex when products require many constructor parameters

The Factory Method pattern is particularly valuable when you have family-related product variants that need to be created in various contexts or when you want to provide extension points in frameworks and libraries.
