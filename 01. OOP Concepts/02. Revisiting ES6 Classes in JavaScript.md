# Revisiting ES6 Classes in JavaScript

JavaScript introduced the `class` keyword in **ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)**, giving developers a more traditional OOP (object-oriented programming) syntax while still relying on JavaScript’s **prototype-based** inheritance under the hood. If you’re coming from a language like Java or C#, ES6 classes can feel more familiar and can help you organize code more cleanly. This blog post covers the essentials of ES6 classes, including constructors, methods, inheritance, static members, and the relatively new concept of **private** and **public** fields.

---

## 1. Class Declarations

A **class declaration** is the most straightforward way to define a class in JavaScript:

```js
class Person {
  // The constructor is automatically called when you create an instance with `new`
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  // Public method
  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

// Creating an instance
const alice = new Person('Alice', 30);
alice.greet(); // "Hello, my name is Alice and I'm 30 years old."
```

Key Points

- Classes are not hoisted like function declarations. You must define the class before you instantiate it.
- The constructor method is optional. If omitted, JavaScript will provide a default constructor.

## 2. Class Expressions

You can also define a class using an expression, which is useful when you want to define a class inline or pass it around as a value:

```js
const Person = class {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name}!`);
  }
};

const bob = new Person('Bob', 25);
bob.greet(); // "Hi, I'm Bob!"
```

- Class expressions can be named or anonymous, just like function expressions.

## 3. Public Fields

Starting with more recent JavaScript versions, you can define public fields (class-level properties) outside of the constructor:

```js
class Car {
  // Public field
  wheels = 4;

  constructor(brand, model) {
    this.brand = brand;
    this.model = model;
  }

  // Public method
  info() {
    console.log(`This car is a ${this.brand} ${this.model} with ${this.wheels} wheels.`);
  }
}

const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla');
myCar.info(); 
// "This car is a Toyota Corolla with 4 wheels."
```

- Public fields are added to each instance, much like defining them in the constructor, but the syntax is cleaner and keeps the constructor focused on essential initialization.

## 4. Private Fields

One of the big additions to modern JavaScript is private class fields, denoted by a leading #. Private fields are truly inaccessible outside the class—unlike earlier “pseudo-private” conventions (like _myField).

```js
class BankAccount {
  // Private fields
  #balance = 0;

  constructor(owner) {
    this.owner = owner;
  }

  deposit(amount) {
    if (amount > 0) {
      this.#balance += amount;
      console.log(`Deposited ${amount}. New balance: ${this.#balance}`);
    }
  }

  withdraw(amount) {
    if (amount > 0 && amount <= this.#balance) {
      this.#balance -= amount;
      console.log(`Withdrew ${amount}. New balance: ${this.#balance}`);
    } else {
      console.log(`Insufficient funds or invalid amount.`);
    }
  }

  // Public method that accesses the private field
  checkBalance() {
    console.log(`Current balance: ${this.#balance}`);
  }
}

const account = new BankAccount('Alice');
account.deposit(1000);  // Deposited 1000. New balance: 1000
account.withdraw(200);  // Withdrew 200. New balance: 800
account.checkBalance(); // Current balance: 800

// Trying to access the private field directly throws an error
// console.log(account.#balance); // Syntax Error
```

Key Points

- Private fields are accessible only within the class body.
- Attempting to read or write #balance from outside the class will result in a syntax error, not just undefined.
- You cannot dynamically reference a private field (e.g., account["#balance"] will not work).

## 5. Methods

### 5.1 Instance Methods

These are defined directly inside the class body. They become part of the class prototype, shared by all instances.

```js
class Rectangle {
  constructor(width, height) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }

  // Instance method
  area() {
    return this.width * this.height;
  }
}

const rect = new Rectangle(10, 5);
console.log(rect.area()); // 50
```

### 5.2 Static Methods

Static methods are called on the class itself rather than on instances. They’re useful for utility functions or factory methods that don’t need instance-specific data.

```js
class MathUtils {
  static add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

console.log(MathUtils.add(5, 7)); // 12
```

- Static methods are not accessible through instances; you must call them via the class name, e.g., MathUtils.add(...).

## 6. Getters and Setters

Getter and setter methods let you control how properties are accessed or mutated. They can be defined directly in the class body:

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this._name = name;
    this._age = age;
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  set name(newName) {
    if (newName && newName.length > 0) {
      this._name = newName;
    }
  }

  get age() {
    return this._age;
  }

  set age(newAge) {
    if (newAge > 0) {
      this._age = newAge;
    }
  }
}

const p = new Person('Alice', 30);
console.log(p.name); // "Alice"
p.name = 'Alicia';
console.log(p.name); // "Alicia"
```

- This approach is often used to validate or transform data when it’s being set or retrieved.
- You can use private fields (#name, #age) in combination with getters and setters for truly encapsulated data.

## 7. Inheritance

You can create subclasses using the extends keyword, and call the parent class constructor with super().

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    // Call parent constructor
    super(name);
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  // Overriding the speak method
  speak() {
    console.log(`${this.name} (a ${this.breed}) barks!`);
  }
}

const dog = new Dog('Buddy', 'Golden Retriever');
dog.speak(); // "Buddy (a Golden Retriever) barks!"
```

Key Points

- super() calls the parent class’s constructor.
- You must call super() before accessing this in the subclass constructor.
	•	Methods with the same name in the child class override the parent’s method.

## 8. Mixins

JavaScript classes do not support multiple inheritance directly, but you can simulate it using mixins—functions that add properties or methods to a class prototype.

```js
function CanEat(Base) {
  return class extends Base {
    eat() {
      console.log(`${this.name} is eating.`);
    }
  };
}

function CanWalk(Base) {
  return class extends Base {
    walk() {
      console.log(`${this.name} is walking.`);
    }
  };
}

class Person {}

class SuperPerson extends CanEat(CanWalk(Person)) {
  constructor(name) {
    super();
    this.name = name;
  }
}

const hero = new SuperPerson('Alice');
hero.eat();  // "Alice is eating."
hero.walk(); // "Alice is walking."
```

- Mixins are a pattern, not a language feature.
- They’re useful if you want to compose behaviors from multiple sources rather than relying on deep inheritance trees.

## Putting It All Together

Below is a more complete example that shows many of these features in one place:

```js
class Vehicle {
  static totalVehicles = 0; // Public static field

  constructor(brand) {
    this.brand = brand;
    Vehicle.totalVehicles++;
  }

  static getVehicleCount() {
    return Vehicle.totalVehicles;
  }

  start() {
    console.log(`${this.brand} vehicle started.`);
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  // Private field
  #mileage = 0;

  constructor(brand, model) {
    super(brand); // call parent constructor
    this.model = model;
  }

  drive(distance) {
    if (distance > 0) {
      this.#mileage += distance;
      console.log(`${this.brand} ${this.model} drove ${distance} miles.`);
    }
  }

  get mileage() {
    return this.#mileage;
  }

  set mileage(value) {
    // Optionally, you could handle setting mileage with conditions
    if (value >= 0) {
      this.#mileage = value;
    }
  }

  // Overriding the start method
  start() {
    console.log(`The ${this.brand} ${this.model} roars to life!`);
  }
}

// Creating instances
const car1 = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla');
car1.start();         // "The Toyota Corolla roars to life!"
car1.drive(50);       // "Toyota Corolla drove 50 miles."
console.log(car1.mileage); // 50

const car2 = new Car('Honda', 'Civic');
car2.drive(100);

// Using static methods/fields
console.log(Vehicle.getVehicleCount()); // 2
```

- Public static field (totalVehicles) keeps track of how many Vehicle instances have been created.
- Private field (#mileage) is used to encapsulate the car’s mileage.
- Getters and setters control access to private fields.
- Overridden methods show polymorphism (start() method in Car overrides the Vehicle version).

## Best Practices for LLD

1. Use Classes for Clarity: When explaining or demonstrating OOP concepts (like inheritance or design patterns), ES6 classes provide a clearer syntax.
2. Private Fields for Encapsulation: Leverage #privateFields to protect internal data.
3. Limit Class Inheritance Depth: Deep inheritance chains can complicate maintenance.
4. Use Static Methods for functionality that doesn’t rely on instance data.
	5.	Keep Constructors Simple: Initialize only essential data in the constructor—use methods or setters for complex setup.

Conclusion

ES6 classes give JavaScript developers a clean, familiar syntax for object-oriented development while retaining the flexibility of the language’s prototype-based core. Whether you’re building large-scale applications or demonstrating Low-Level Design principles, understanding how to effectively use classes, inheritance, and private fields will help you write more structured and maintainable code.
	•	Key Takeaway: Embrace ES6 classes for readability and maintainability, but remember that JavaScript’s underlying inheritance model is still prototype-based.
	•	Next Steps: Explore design patterns (like Singleton, Factory, or Observer) implemented in ES6 classes to deepen your OOP understanding in JavaScript.
