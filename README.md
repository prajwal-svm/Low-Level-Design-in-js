## Overview

This repository provides a structured approach to learning and implementing low-level design concepts in JavaScript. Each topic is explained with:

- Clear, simple explanations of the concept
- Practical code examples in modern JavaScript
- Real-world use cases and applications
- Benefits and drawbacks of each approach
- Best practices for implementation

The content is organized in a progressive manner, starting with fundamental OOP concepts, moving to SOLID principles, and then exploring various design patterns categorized by their purpose (creational, structural, and behavioral).

## How to Use This Repository

1. **For Beginners**: Start with the OOP Concepts section to build a solid foundation
2. **For Intermediate Developers**: Focus on SOLID principles to improve your code quality
3. **For Advanced Developers**: Explore the design patterns to solve common design problems
4. **As a Reference**: Bookmark specific patterns or principles to revisit when needed
